## Project Description

This project is a drum kit made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking on the corresponding drum pad. The sounds are triggered by key presses as well.

The project includes a set of nine different drum pads, each with its own unique sound. The user can choose which sound they want to play by clicking on the corresponding pad. They can also trigger the sounds using their keyboard. 

 ## Topivs Covered 
 - <small>Event listeners - The window.addEventListener method is used to add a keydown event listener to the window object. The keys.forEach method is used to add a transitionend event listener to each element with the class key.</small>
 - <small>DOM manipulation - The document.querySelector method is used to select the audio and key elements based on their data-key attribute values.</small>
 - <small>Conditionals - The if statement is used to check if the audio variable is not null before setting its currentTime property and calling the play method.</small>
 - <small>CSS transitions - The removeTransition function removes the playing class from the key element when the transitionend event occurs, but only if the propertyName property of the event object is equal to 'transform'.</small>
 - <small>Functions - The playSound and removeTransition functions are used to handle the keydown and transitionend events, respectively.</small>
